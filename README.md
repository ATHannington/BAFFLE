# BAFFLE
### **BAFFLE** - BAsic Fortan FLuids Engine: A basic fixed cartesian grid, flux-based, second-order hydrodynamics code in Fortran90.

> [!NOTE]
> This project has concluded. Further work is unlikely. Please be aware that this project was for learning purposes, and the software is not optimised, fully debugged, or complete.**

> [!WARNING]
> This code is extremely memory inefficient due to the (naive) use of a global variable, an N-dimensional array to track the fluid properties. Please use it with caution!

BAFFLE is, as the name suggests, a rather basic fluids engine written in Fortran90. 

To run BAFFLE is rather simple, as it is designed to be as modular as possible. To run:

1. Download all of the files from this repository. You must download **AT LEAST ONE FILE FROM EACH FOLDER** and **ADAPT TO RELEVANT NUMBER OF DIMENSIONS IF NECESSARY**. The BAFFLE code provided is **NOT** exhaustive and was written by the author within a limited time-frame, and with limited experience.
2. Setup Initial Conditions subroutine file to choose the setup you wish to model
3. Configure the relevant constants module file for desired resolution, accuracy (first or second order), run time, isothermal/adiabatic setup, and number of outputs and output location etc.
4. Compile your files using your choice of compiler (the author used Gfortran on Linux)
5. Run the executable file generated by your compiler, and perform data analysis as you desire.
